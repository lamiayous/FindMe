# FindMe
Find me is a content based search and retrieval project. You can query images from a database by uploading images that look like the images you are looking for. FindMe returns images most relevant to your search. In future, this will be used to query certain object the user is looking for from a video stream. However right now, FindMe can only retrieve car images from an example database.
